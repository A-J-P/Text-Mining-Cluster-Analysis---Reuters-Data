# Text Mining/Cluster-Analysis-Reuters-Data  

Reuters banking data

Analyze two articles chosen from the Reuters

news archive to find their main topics. By using text mining method, we first

transform texts into numeric data. Then we make the data into reasonable

clusters to find out the main topics by figuring out the best cluster group size and

best weighting. The same procedure will repeat for another article to compare

the results with the first article.
